# AI-Based-Hybrid-Fertilizer-Recommendation-System

# 🌱 AI-Based Hybrid Fertilizer Recommendation System



## 🚀 Project Overview

Fertilizer selection is crucial for optimal crop yield, but incorrect usage leads to soil degradation and financial loss for farmers. This AI-powered hybrid system integrates **Random Forest** and **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to provide accurate and cost-effective fertilizer recommendations based on soil and weather conditions.
